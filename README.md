## 📱 Device Frames

> iPhone 16 Pro · iPhone 15 Pro · Samsung S24 Ultra · Pixel 9 Pro · OnePlus 12 · iPad Pro · + Custom devices

## 🧠 How It Works

```
1. Upload your app screenshots
2. AI analyzes each screen & suggests feature headlines
3. You approve the headline/content mapping based on your screens.
4. Screenshots generated — one by one, consistent style
5. Files land in your project folder. Done.
```

### The Secret Sauce

Every screenshot follows **3 iron rules**:

- 📐 **Device fills 65%+** of the frame — your app is the hero
- 🔤 **Text never overlaps** the device screen — ever
- 🧹 **Clean backgrounds** — no clutter, no floating icons

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install the Skill

Copy the `app-screenshot-generator` folder into your AI agent's skills directory:

```bash
cp -r app-screenshot-generator/ ~/.your-agent/skills/
```

### 2. Use It

Just ask your AI agent:

> *"Generate Play Store screenshots for my app"*

The skill takes over from there.

### Requirements

- An AI coding agent with `generate_image` capability
- Python 3.8+ (for the prompt engine)
- That's it.

## 🎯 Built For

- **Indie devs** who can't afford a designer
- **Startups** moving too fast for Figma mockups
- **Side projects** that deserve better than basic screenshots
