**No Figma. No templates. Just results. Targeting the Indies.**

> [!NOTE]
> Tools like Antigravity do not generate images with a 9:16 aspect ratio yet. But no worries—just generate your screenshots here, and later go to the ChatGPT or Gemini app and have them resize (to aspect ratio required) without messing up the design of the screenshots.

<h2>🧠 Brains Behind The Beauty</h2>

This isn't just a wrapper. It's a deterministic prompt engine that enforces design rules:

| Step | Action |
|:---:|:---|
| **1. ANALYSIS** | AI scans each uploaded image to understand the feature. |
| **2. MAPPING** | It maps 'Home Screen' -> 'Your Day at a Glance' headline. |
| **3. COMPOSING** | Enforces 65% device visibility (no tiny phones!). |
| **4. RENDERING** | Generates consistent lighting, shadows, and textures. |

<br>

<h3>The Iron Rules 🛡️</h3>

Every generated image is strictly guarded by these constraints:

❌ **No Text Overlap**: Text never touches the UI.<br>
📐 **Device Dominance**: Phone must fill 65%+ of the frame.<br>
🧹 **Zero Clutter**: No random flying 3D objects.
